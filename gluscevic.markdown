<a href="https://eonadler.github.io/"> Ethan O. Nadler</a> (Carnegie-USC postdoc 2021-present): Ethan is an expert on zoom-in simulations in non-cold dark matter cosmologies, near-field cosmology, and galaxy formation and evolution.

![Trey]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/GeorgeDriskell.png){:width="45%"}

Trey Driskell (PhD student): Trey's thesis focuses on the cosmological 21-cm signal, interacting dark matter models, and galaxy formation.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryan-rahimieh/"> Aryan Rahimieh </a> (PhD student): Aryan is working on forecasting sensitivity of future experiments to measuring fundamental parameters of dark matter. 

![Wendy]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/WendyCrumrine.jpg){:width="45%"}

<a href="https://brightinsightslearning.com/about-me/"> Wendy Crumrine </a> (PhD student): Wendy is using Milky Way satellite abundance measurements to probe dark matter featuring interactions with neutrinos and photons. 

![AdamHe]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/AdamHe.jpg){:width="45%"}

Adam He (USC PhD): Adam is using the effective theory of structure formation to probe new physics with LSS observables.

![Karime]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/Karime.png){:width="45%"}

<a href="https://karimemaamari.com/"> Karime Maamari </a> (PhD Student): Karime derived the most stringent astrophysical bounds to-date on dark matter-baryon scattering, using Milky Way satellite abundance measurements from DES; he now works on developing the first galaxy formation simulations that include dark matter-proton elastic scattering.
