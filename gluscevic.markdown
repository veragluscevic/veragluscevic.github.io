If you are a USC undergraduate student interested the work we do email me at <b>vera.gluscevic@usc.edu</b>. If you are looking for a posdoc position email me at <b>vera.gluscevic@usc.edu</b>. I particularly encourage applications from postdocs and students committed to advocacy for diversity and inclusion in physics. At this time I am not accepting high school students.

![RuiAn]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/RuiAn.jpg){:width="45%"}

Rui An (postdoc 2021-present): Rui works on constraining the mass and interactions of dark matter and other cosmological probes of new physics.

![Ethan Nadler]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/EthanNadler.jpg){:width="45%"} 

<a href="https://eonadler.github.io/"> Ethan O. Nadler</a> (Carnegie-USC postdoc 2021-present): Ethan works on state-of-the art zoom-in simulations in non-cold dark matter cosmologies, introducing inference to near-field cosmology to robustly search for signatures of new physics in local observables.


![Trey]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/GeorgeDriskell.png){:width="45%"}

Trey Driskell (USC PhD student 2030-present): Trey is investigating the global 21-cm signal in context of interacting dark matter models that can change the thermal history of the universe.

![Aryan]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/AryanRahimieh.jpg){:width="45%"}

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryan-rahimieh/"> Aryan Rahimieh </a> (USC PhD student 2019-present): Aryan is working on a novel way to detect interactions of axion-like particles with electrons, using 21-cm line intensity mapping. As his second project, he is working on the Fisher forecasting of global 21-cm signal to put constraints on astrophysical parameters as well as model dependent DM mass and cross section. 

![Wendy]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/WendyCrumrine.jpg){:width="45%"}

<a href="https://brightinsightslearning.com/about-me/"> Wendy Crumrine </a> (USC PhD student 2021-present): Wendy is using Milky Way satellite abundance measurements to derive constraints on non-cold dark matter cosmological models; in particular, models in which dark mater interacts with neutrinos or photons. 

![AdamHe]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/AdamHe.jpg){:width="45%"}

Adam He (USC PhD student 2020-present): Adam is using the effective theory of structure formation to enable calculation of non-linear evolution of cosmological perturbations in non-cold dark matter cosmologies.

![Karime]({{veragluscevic.github.io}}/assets/img/Karime.png){:width="45%"}

<a href="https://karimemaamari.com/"> Karime Maamari </a> (USC PhD Student 2019-present) Karime derived the most stringent astrophysical bounds to-date on dark matter-baryon scattering, using Milky Way satellite abundance measurements from DES.
