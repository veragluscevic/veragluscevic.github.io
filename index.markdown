Dr. Vera Gluscevic is a Gabilan Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/physics/"> University of Southern California </a> (USC). As a postdoc, she was an Eric Schmidt Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. She received her PhD in Astrophysics at Caltech and her undergraduate degree in Astrophysics from the University of Belgrade, Serbia.

Dr. Gluscevic's group at USC uses cosmological and astrophysical observations to test fundamental theories of physics. Their work focuses on resolving some the biggest mysteries of modern science--the nature of cosmological dark matter and dark energy, the dominant constituents of our Universe at present time.  Dr. Gluscevic is one of the founding members of two large international collaborations: CMB-S4 and the Simons Observatory Collaboration (SO), both working to build the next-generation ground-based observatories to measure anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation---heat leftover from the Big Bang and the first free-streaming light in our Universe---with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. The new data from the CMB observatories will allow measurement of the neutrino, stress-test dark matter theory, and help to address tensions between observational data sets. Dr. Gluscevic has served on the CMB-S4 Executive Committee and led the Likelihood and Theory working group for SO, and in both instances helped to shape their scinence programs, leading their dark matter science definition and forecasts. In 2022, she received USC Raubenheimer Outstanding Junior Faculty Award, and in 2023, she was named a Cottrell Scholar by the Research Corporation for Science Advancement. Her research is supported by the NSF and NASA astrophysics theory programs.
