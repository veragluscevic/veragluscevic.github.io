<p>
Vera is a Gabilan Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/physics/"> University of Southern California </a>. Her research focuses on cosmological probes of fundamental physics and aims to unravel some of the biggest mysteries of modern physics: the physical nature of dark matter and dark energy. As a postdoc, she was an Eric Schmidt Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and got her PhD in astrophysics at Caltech. Vera began as an undergrad in astrophysics at the University of Belgrade, in her native Serbia. 
 
Vera is one of the founding members of two large international collaborations, CMB-S4 and the Simons Observatory Collaboration (SO), working to build the next-generation ground-based observatories for measuring the cosmic microwave background radiation. She served on the CMB-S4 Executive Committee and led the Likelihood and Theory working group for SO, and in both instances helped to shape the scinence goals of these programs, leading their dark matter science definition and forecasts. In 2022, Vera received USC Raubenheimer Outstanding Junior Faculty Award. In 2023, she was named a Cottrell Scholar by the Research Corporation for Science Advancement. Her research is supported by NSF and NASA through astroparticle/cosmology and astrophysics theory programs.
