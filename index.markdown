Vera Gluscevic is a Gabilan Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/physics/"> University of Southern California </a>. Her research focuses on cosmological and astrophysical probes of fundamental physics and aims to unravel some of the biggest mysteries of modern physics: the physical nature of dark matter and dark energy. As a postdoc, she was an Eric Schmidt Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton; she received her PhD in Astrophysics at Caltech and her undergraduate degree in Astrophysics at the University of Belgrade, Serbia. 
 
Professor Gluscevic is one of the founding members of two large international collaborations, CMB-S4 and the Simons Observatory Collaboration (SO), working to build the next-generation ground-based observatories that would measure the cosmic microwave background radiation---heat leftover from the Big Bang and the first free-streaming light in our Universe---with unprecedented precision. The new data from these observatories will allow us to measure the mass of neutrino particles and learn about the thermal history of dark matter, measure the curvature of the universe and address cosmological tensions between different data sets. Professor Gluscevic previously served on the CMB-S4 Executive Committee and led the Likelihood and Theory working group for SO, and in both instances helped to shape the scinence goals of these programs, leading their dark matter science definition and forecasts. In 2022, she received USC Raubenheimer Outstanding Junior Faculty Award, and in 2023, she was named a Cottrell Scholar by the Research Corporation for Science Advancement. Her research is supported by NSF and NASA through astroparticle/cosmology and astrophysics theory programs.
