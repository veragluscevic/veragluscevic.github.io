Gluscevic group at USC studies the entire Universe as a physical system. We combine the tools of theoretical astroparticle physics, numerical simulation, and astronomical data analysis, and put to use observations that span the entire cosmic history---from the cosmic microwave background radiation to dwarf galaxies in orbit around the Milky Way---to test the fundamental fabric of nature. Our effort aims at understanding one of the biggest mysteries of modern science: the nature of cosmological dark matter and dark energy and the processes that shaped the Universe before the time of the first stars. Below are our recent research highlights.

<b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10000"> Probing dark matter with the smallest galaxies </a> </b>

<p style="margin-bottom: 35px">
student project: Ethan Nadler (Stanford)

  
We introduce and apply a new method to constrain dark matter interactions with baryonic particles in the early universe, using a population of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way.

</p>

 We limit dark matter interactions to be 1000 times weaker than previous studies allowed. This work was highlighted in AAS Nova.

<b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10165"> Disentangling dark physics with cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropy </a></b>

<p style="margin-bottom: 35px">
student project: Zack Li (Princeton)

  
We forecast sensitivity of the next-generation cosmic microwave background observations to dark matter physics, and show how to disentangle it from other physical effects.

These forecasts fed into the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 calculations of sensitivity to dark matter.

<b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07133"> First cosmological test of sub-proton-mass dark matter scattering with baryons</a></b>

<p style="margin-bottom: 35px">

Here's the first cosmological limit on interactions of sub-proton-mass dark matter particles with baryons.

</p>

The result was obtained from measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy from the Planck satellite.

<b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07808"> Can annual modulation signal help identify dark matter theory?</a></b>

<p style="margin-bottom: 35px">
student project: Sam Witte (UCLA)

Dark matter direct detection experiments are currently collecting data, in hopes of discovering signal from dark matter particles.

</p>

In this work, we discuss how Earth's motion around the Sun and the resulting annual modulation of a putative dark-matter signal may be used to distinguish amongst candidate theories that could describe these elusive particles. Check out our dmdd python package.

<b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06327"> Measuring primordial magnetic fields with 21-cm tomography</a></b>

<p style="margin-bottom: 35px">

A proposal for a cool new way to trace tiny magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium during Dark Ages, using future tomographic measurements of the cosmological 21-cm signal from atomic hydrogen. 

<p align="center">

</p>

With a 21-cm experiment consisting of 1 square km of dipole antennas, B fields as small as 10^-21 Gauss and coherent over megaparces scales could be within reach.

<b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02936"> Searching for dark matter-proton interactions </a></b>

<p style="margin-bottom: 35px">
student project: Karime Maamari (USC)

We compute new bounds on the rate of dark matter-proton scattering at a time when the Universe was ~2 months old. The results are entirely based on linear cosmological perturbation theory and constrain dark matter interaction physics for a broad range of dark matter models.

They improve upon previous astrophysical bounds on the scattering cross section by 5 orders of magnitude.
