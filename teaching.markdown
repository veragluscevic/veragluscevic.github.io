ASTR 540 (Spring 2022): Advanced Cosmology
<p>
Astro 540 is an advanced cosmology course that takes students towards a deeper physical understanding of our universe. The target audience for this course includes beginning graduate students and advanced undergraduates in astrophysics, with the goal to prepare them for research in this field. Students taking this course will have already taken undergraduate-level mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and special relativity, and at least one astrophysics or general-relativity based course. In addition, basic programming skills, and a programming background in python is particularly helpful, though not necessary. 
This course briefly covers key concepts that describe the evolution and content of a
homogenous, expanding universe, and then transitions to a deep dive into advanced topics in
physical cosmology, focusing on cosmological perturbation theory, inflation, structure formation,
cosmic microwave background anisotropy, gravitational lensing, dark matter, dark energy, and
the particle dynamics in the early and late universe. The course balances theoretical aspects of
modern cosmology with their practical application to data ‚Äì it thus covers the most commonly
used computational methods and other tools cosmologists use in their everyday research.

Cosmology ASTR 424 (spring 2020): upper-division undergraduate course on cosmology.
</p>
Astro 424 is an upper-level undergraduate introduction to cosmology. The course discusses the standard big bang theory of the universe and introduces the current theory for the origin and growth of large-scale structure. The course talks about basic equations describing the universe, the expansion and age of the universe, dark matter and dark energy, the thermal history of the universe, the origin of the light elements, the cosmic microwave background, the growth of density perturbations and cosmological inflation. Emphasis is placed on comparison of theory with observations.

<p>
Astro 100 is a course were we address some of the questions as old as humankind, ‚ÄúWhat is the universe?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is our place in it?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow old is it?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is it made out
of?‚Äù, and so on. We take a journey from our Solar System all the way to the farthest reaches of space and time and take a deeper look into the physics underlying astronomical phenomena. We discuss how the science of astronomy has tremendously helped the development of physics, and how physics enables the understanding of the entire universe. This course is designed specifically for those non-science majors who have very little, if any, background in the sciences and mathematics. The course is non-mathematical by prerequisite, some calculations will be necessary. One of the goals of this course is to show students how scientific thinking applied in astronomy can also be useful in everyday life.
