<a style="font-weight:bold; color:blue;">Advanced Cosmology:<\a> <a href="https://veragluscevic.github.io/"> ASTR 540 (Spring 2022)</a>
  
<br>An advanced cosmology course for beginning graduate students and advanced astrophysics majors. The objective of the course is to equip students with the conceptual vocabulary and technical skills to engage with the specialized literature and research in the field. The course gives a brief overview of a homogenous universe and then transitions to a deep dive into advanced topics in physical cosmology, focusing on cosmological perturbation theory, inflation, structure formation, cosmic microwave background anisotropy, gravitational lensing, dark matter, dark energy, and
the thermal history of the universe. With a mix of traditional lectures, in-class group exercises, and student presentations, it balances theoretical aspects of modern cosmology with their practical application to data.

Cosmology ASTR 424 (spring 2020): upper-division undergraduate course on cosmology.
</p>
Astro 424 is an upper-level undergraduate introduction to cosmology for astrophysics and physics majors at USC. The course discusses the standard big bang theory of the universe and introduces the current theory for the origin and growth of large-scale structure. The course talks about basic equations describing the universe, the expansion and age of the universe, dark matter and dark energy, the thermal history of the universe, the origin of the light elements, the cosmic microwave background, the growth of density perturbations and cosmological inflation. Emphasis is placed on comparison of theory with observations.

CosmoLab Hacks (2019-2021): Extracurricular weekly data analysis tutorials for USC grads/undergrads. CosmoLab hacks are still happening a few times a semester, on as-needed basis, and are targeting use of advanced computational tools for research in cosmology.

ASTR 100 (spring 2020, fall 2021): general-education course, introduction to the Universe.
</p>

<p>
Astro 100 is a course addressing some of the questions as old as humankind: ‚ÄúWhat is our place in the universe?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow old is the universe?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is it made out of?‚Äù, and so on. The course lectures takes a journey from our Solar System, all the way to the farthest reaches of space and time, unveiling the physics underlying astronomical phenomena. The course is designed for non-science majors who have little, if any, background in the sciences and mathematics, and the course labs offer a gentle introduction to simple calculations that help elucidate key concepts from the lectures. Lectures involve think-pair-share exercises and in-class discussion sessions. One of the goals of the course is to use astronomy to showcase scientific thinking applied in scineces and in everyday life.
